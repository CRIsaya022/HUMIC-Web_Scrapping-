  "summary": "### Definition of Machine Learning\n- Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. It allows systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and improve their performance over time.\n\n### Types of Machine Learning\n- **Supervised Learning**: This type involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which includes both input data and the correct output. Common applications include classification and regression tasks.\n- **Unsupervised Learning**: In this approach, the model is trained on data without labeled responses, allowing it to identify patterns and relationships in the data. Examples include clustering and association.\n- **Reinforcement Learning**: This type of ML focuses on training agents to make a series of decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward, often used in robotics and game playing.\n\n### Applications of Machine Learning\n- Machine Learning has significant applications across various industries, such as:\n  - **Healthcare**: ML algorithms assist in diagnosing diseases and personalizing treatment plans.\n  - **Finance**: Used for credit scoring, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading.\n  - **Retail**: Enhances customer experience through recommendation systems and inventory management.\n  - **Transportation**: Powers autonomous vehicles and optimizes route planning."
